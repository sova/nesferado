Or give everyone a freebie haha.

Rating submissions work
and update in the ratings file
but do not check the author of comments or posts for equality / eponymity

submissions work and simple problems were fixed by (swap! atom vec) on the cljs side.

wanna get ratings working for all pieces

auto sorting

auto trashing of unusefuls

auto archiving of usefuls after timespan

and figure out routing after incoporating serversent/blurbs and callbacks.

make sure input fields get cleared on (chsk-send! ...)
so far so groovy.
i think user pages will actually be different than the app.
they will be static pages, which is easy, I can just do (GET "/user/:name") and have it rock my socks.
Compojure destructuring is a beautiful thing.  And the static pages can still be generated from the atom.
So that's a plus.

Not clearing input fields for some reason,
dunno.

:value was mussing


DEC 31 12:11 pm

  https://github.com/clojure/data.int-map
   for fast int mapses

   by the way, logins never expire
   provided the user has the login key,
   so...
   mabe change that in the future
   for securita

 dozing off attempting to implement :clientsent/new-post-map

 needs:

 :serversent/new-post-map
 :serversent/new-comment-map
 :serversent/all-the-posts (current posts and comments)
 :serversent/rating-update

 :clientsent/new-post-map
 :clientsent/new-rating-map
 :clientsent/new-comment-map
 :clientsent/req-all-posts

DEC 29

  Submit things (tie plumbs into

                    create-account
                    send-blurb
                    send-rating

                    these also need to Clear Out their respective input boxen


                    )

  show user-specific profile pages [in- app?]


           this is problematic? because it requires conjing
           onto the clientside atom data that it doesn't have...

           but user data is very minimal
           probably best to only serve when actually requested
  i guess in-app?  but how to seversent/author-data.... hrm...



  broadcast out  & think and ponder subscription scheme,
  seems like a reverse index and plain index are key.


  accountant is dope and routing works.

  but will need some careful tinkering
  once we do categorical pages such as "new" etc
  unless we are starting to render from a different atom altogether for that,
  in which case it may be very easy.



DEC 27
  holy smokes son!
  you can do routing via query params!

  :D

  /?v=top&nfid=517




  ratings on tiles in progress.

DEC 26

  add ratings to tiles

  and track events for ease of transmitting...

  and render based on client-side atom for ease of replicas
