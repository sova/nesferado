 :clientsent/new-post-map
 :clientsent/new-rating-map

DEC 29

  Submit things (tie plumbs into

                    create-account
                    send-blurb
                    send-rating

                    these also need to Clear Out their respective input boxen


                    )

  show user-specific profile pages [in- app?]


           this is problematic? because it requires conjing
           onto the clientside atom data that it doesn't have...

           but user data is very minimal
           probably best to only serve when actually requested
  i guess in-app?  but how to seversent/author-data.... hrm...



  broadcast out  & think and ponder subscription scheme,
  seems like a reverse index and plain index are key.


  accountant is dope and routing works.

  but will need some careful tinkering
  once we do categorical pages such as "new" etc
  unless we are starting to render from a different atom altogether for that,
  in which case it may be very easy.



DEC 27
  holy smokes son!
  you can do routing via query params!

  :D

  /?v=top&nfid=517




  ratings on tiles in progress.

DEC 26

  add ratings to tiles

  and track events for ease of transmitting...

  and render based on client-side atom for ease of replicas
